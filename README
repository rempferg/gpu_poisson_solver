Compile with

    nvcc -l cufft gpu_poisson_solver.cu'
    
Output at various stages of the computations can be enabled by defining any 
combination of the precompiler constants

    OUTPUT
    OUTPUT_GF
    OUTPUT_CHARGE
    OUTPUT_CHARGE_FFT
    OUTPUT_CHARGE_FFT_GF
    OUTPUT_POTENTIAL
    
The results can be visualized with gnuplot using

    splot "file.dat" w pm3d


Known issues:
- grid is cubic
- grid is 2D
- some grid sized cause a segfault before multiplying with the greensfunction
